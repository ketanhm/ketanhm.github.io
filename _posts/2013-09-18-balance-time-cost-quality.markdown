Typical organization spends 70%-75% of its technology budget on 2 areas: Infrastructure technology (foundational) and transaction technology (business operations, running processes).

## Best practices

- Technology Portfolio Rationalization
- Running lesser number of applications, reduces maintenance/operating costs
- Moving more applications to public cloud infrastructure, takes advantage of volume/utility based pricing
- Modern App Stack/Cloud native results in business agility
- Reduced risk of legacy apps, reduce risk of excessive batch windows, more real time operational view of business
- Evolve from ‘Systems of Record’ to ‘Systems of Engagement’
- Transactional technology provides Applications/Info systems to process Quote to Cash, Procure to Pay, the core processes which bring cash flow to enterprise. Use Managed Services-based to achieve:
    - Year on year productivity improvements (Cost Containment)
    - Use Global Delivery model & leverage wage arbitrage (Cost Reduction)
- IT outsourcing is a strategic practice where companies entrust specific IT functions or tasks to external service providers. This cost-effective approach allows organizations to tap into specialized expertise, reduce operational overhead, and focus on core business activities

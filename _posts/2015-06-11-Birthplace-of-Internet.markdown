([UCLA](https://samueli.ucla.edu/)) is often referred to as the birthplace of the internet. On October 29, 1969, the first message was sent from here over Arpanet network (developed by DARPA - Defense Advanced Research Project Agency), turning the mathematical theory of packet switching into the foundation of the modern internet.

Based on packet switching (compared to circuit switching commonly used for voice then), the sharing of information digitally from this first node of ARPANET launched the Internet revolution. Below is the conceptual design of Arpanet.

Below is the image of the very first Interface Message Processor (IMP), built by BBN. It was the first generation of gateways, which are known today as routers. The message was sent to the Stanford Research Institute. The first message between the two IMPs was "LO" — phonetically, "Hello" — but the SRI host crashed before the UCLA researcher could complete typing the "LOGIN" command.

The IMP was the packet switching node used to interconnect participant networks to the ARPANET from the late 1960s to 1989.

Gartner defines Bimodal as the practice of managing two separate but coherent styles of work: one focused on predictability; the other on exploration. 

Mode 1 or Run, is optimized for areas that are more predictable and well-understood. It focuses on exploiting what is known, while renovating the legacy environment into a state that is fit for a digital world. Traditionally this was the Keeping-the-lights-on (KTLO), and consumes majority of budget.

Mode 2 or Build is exploratory, experimenting to solve new problems and optimized for areas of uncertainty. These initiatives often begin with a hypothesis that is tested and adapted during a process involving short iterations, potentially adopting a minimum viable product (MVP) approach. Traditionally this was the innovation part of budget.

Both modes are essential to create substantial value and drive significant organizational change, and neither is static

Smaller agile teams can be high-touch collaborative. Large enterprise agile software team are distributed (typically global). The trade-off (of co-location) is done at these large enterprises as they: 

- operate in global markets, 
- leverage global talent pool, 
- want to contain cost.

While going agile, enterprise watch out for:

- Increased speed of delivery, increased changes, do not create regular outages (otherwise continuous delivery becomes continuous pain for customers)

- No tracking of what is done, where, when, how (Audit Risk â€“ in regulated industries)

- Burned out staff

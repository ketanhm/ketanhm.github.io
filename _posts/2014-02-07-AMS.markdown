Typical organization spends 70%-75% of its technology budget on 2 areas: Infrastructure technology (foundational) and transaction technology (business operations, running processes).

See my earlier [blog](https://ketanhm.github.io/posts/balance-time-cost-quality/)

Service Providers offer Applications Managed Services(AMS) to maintain client applications and technology infrastructure, including Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software, legacy systems, portals and middleware. They may even provide hosting services. Clients benefit from providers knowledge of best practice processes, gaining cost reductions and optimized operations.

It incorporates the industry-proven Information Technology Information Library (ITIL) framework. ITIL provides a framework that gives IT teams the flexibility and stability they need to support the business successfully.

Mortgage Industry is the best example of  technological innovation leading to dis-intermediation and dramatic growth of non-bank mortgage lending after the global financial crisis. Non-bank lenders have become dominant in the mortgage market, after banks retreated and became risk averse, and not scale/be elastic per business demands.

FinTech lenders process mortgage applications much faster than traditional banks. Faster lending has not increased defaults, help increase refinancing and at the same time not biased/predatory to marginal borrowers.

Transforming to a digital lending model drives quantifiable bottom line impact by expanding & accelerating the sales funnel while reducing costs through greater process efficiency.

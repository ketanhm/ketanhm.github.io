As 2019 closes, and I reflect on my conversations this year with Functional/Technology leaders, the value of **Digital Business** couldn’t be clearer.

**Digital Transformation** is the drive to improve ***Top line*** and ***Bottom line*** by re-imagining current business and improving its performance, using software/digital technologies as enablers. 

Across industries, such as Financial Services, Retail, Hi-Tech Manufacturing and Retail-CPG, digital technologies helped achieve 3 key business imperatives & Transformations:

## 1. Improving Customer Experience
Helping build a connected experience by providing contextual & continuous (personalized, omni channel) and capability-rich journeys (API’s to internal/external application, connecting front/Middle/back office, increasing digital/self-service over in-person/voice) to Customers (partners, employees).

**Retail:** Enabling customers to “Buy online Pickup in Store (BOPIS)” and “Buy Online Return in Store (BORIS); helping reduce shipment costs, increase in-store traffic and impulse buying

**Digital Finance:** A home buyer using mobile device to ‘Explore’, ‘Research’, and do a Quick Application for mortgage; using Web to ‘Complete’ application, uploading documents, visiting a Brick-Mortar office to ‘Close’: and using mobile/web to staying ‘Engaged’ post move-in to new home

## 2. Becoming Data Driven
Analyzing years of customer data (disparate systems) and making it available across applications/users to improve customer experience, increasing operations efficiencies and launch new revenue/growth opportunities. Applying AI/ML to personalize customer care, increasing productivity, targeted campaigns, reducing churn and others.

**Online Brokerage:** machine learning algorithms for data-driven goal planning, rebalancing, and diversification

**Online Lender:** approving loans online in sub-seconds, using data models for credit risks, fraud prevention

**Hi-Tech Manufacturer:** Improving supply chain efficiencies

**Hotel Chain:** a data repository that can service guest profile data to various application (mobile, web, front-desk, guest care/contact center) with a sub-second response

## 3. Running a Least cost, most available and scalable IT Infrastructure
With maturing of cloud offerings, Enterprises are using a mix of OnPrem, Cloud-based and SaaS Infrastructure. These has created a need of being able to opportunistically move workloads across infra by utilizing micro-services and containerization.

High Availability Application: Running it on a private PaaS solution to meet objective of reducing infra cost, responding to market/volume spikes, RTO <3 Hours, RPO<3 hours, RCO of 50%

# Digital Transformation in 2020 and beyond
As we began our next decade, some of the current buzz-words/pitches will gain solid traction and become widely adopted. Digital transformation will continue and the push to improve ***Top Line*** and ***Bottom Line*** continues. And at end of 2020, I wish I have successful use-cases to share with digital technologies such as:

**IoT:** Sensors and applications to monitor goods through the supply chain, logistics, food safety, asset tracking, smart tags to thwart counterfeiting

**VR/AR:** Provide rich customer experience at each stage of their journey. A step towards experience economy

**Chatbots & Virtual Assistants:** Better response to human interactions and drive higher customer satisfaction

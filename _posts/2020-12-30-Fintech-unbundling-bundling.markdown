Fintech drove the financial services industry transformation by adopting to consumer digital experience expectations and data-driven innovations. Traditional universal banking providers were more focused on meeting regulations/compliance and few invested in digital innovation teams (checkmark to boards). However, markets are fast-moving and it appears that Fintech is on a path of rebundling financial services. Till now revenues and market share of all participants have increased, but if there are universal Fintechs (or a Big Tech jumps in), then the financial services market is going to structurally change for benefit of consumer.


BFSI were driving to become **Universal Financial Service Provider** -- all in one shop

![Universal FSI](https://ketanhm.github.io/images/bfsi.png){: w="700" h="400" }

* Providers strived to offer bundled products and services on disparate, legacy platforms
Individual LOB platforms, individual consumer facing SoR, few common Platforms, LOB infra platforms - structured around bank’s delivery channels

* FANG++ set consumer's digital expectations
Fintech understood consumer pain, addressed friction points, and unbundled banks by offering any-time, any-where, any-device delivery of its services

# Fintech unbundled the leaders in BFSI by:

* Offering mobile first experience
* Hyper focused on single use-case/market/experience
* Focused Targeting (Underserved, Student, Fractional use, Student, near-prime, usage based)
* Algorithmic (Robo advisory, lower costs)
* API’s, Microservices, Cloud Native, no legacy, User Centered Design
* Avoid Multiple Apps/websites to visit- no longer fragmented customer journey

# Fintech moving to bundling more offering

Having established a customer base, fintech's are now growing their offerings and looking more like tradition BFSI providers. BFSI providers are also creating inhouse/partnering fintech to grow to become Universal service provider. Interesting to watch how a major tech companies gets regulatory approval to challenge.

# Fintech Way
* Start and establish one service and establish consumer relationship
* Capture consumer data, enrich consumer identity, build own AI/credit scoring data model
* Leverage own data models to rebundle services around the consumer
* Leverage open standards – Open Banking, PSD2 or establish them to take leadership
* Few breakout fintech 2.0 – Ant, GS-Marcus, SoFi, Stripe, Square

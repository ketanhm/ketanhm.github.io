Continuous delivery approach enables software team to consistently deliver high-quality software at speed.  

Tempo measures the velocity of changes that are being made, and stability metrics measures the quality of the changes delivered and the team’s ability to repair failures. 

These metrics measurement must be at application or service level and between similar applications, industry, users (context matters).

Top performing organizations have high scores on all 4 metrics. Low performers have the challenge/tradeoffs between tempo vs stability. 

Keeping the size of change small for an application helps. It moves to delivery faster and also easier to recover from failure.

[DORA](https://dora.dev/) runs a research program that and seeks to understand the capabilities that drive software delivery and operations performance. They have a [quick-check](https://dora.dev/quickcheck/) survey on their website, that helps to assess your software delivery performance and recommend improvement areas.

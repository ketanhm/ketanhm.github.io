As a seasoned Senior Client Partner, I empower clients to drive business outcomes through the strategic application of cutting-edge digital technologies. My expertise lies in accelerating revenue growth, streamlining processes, and reducing costs while ensuring regulatory compliance.

I excel in building trusted relationships with executive clients, providing tailored consulting services that address their unique needs. By combining industry acumen with technical know-how, I craft comprehensive digital transformation programs that align seamlessly with clients' objectives.

My guiding principles for delivering exceptional client success are:


**1. Keeping the client focus:** Be client advocate to internal leadership(suppliers’) and keep business focus. Sync to client objectives. Be the bridge between client requirement and delivery organization

**2. Being Agile:** Adapt to changing requirement within contractually limits. Don’t underestimate technology (new) challenges. Factor time and resources for experimentation on new tech/tools

**3. Build global Team & lead for Success:** Make case to staff right skilled resources(global, matrixed org), align teams to client objectives/tech requirements, plan for unexpected personnel changes/backups

**4. Keep an oversight on Project/Program:** Do proactive planning, ensure not overcommitting / unrealistic schedules. Bring to client notice any plan deviations (& mitigation steps) as soon as identified
